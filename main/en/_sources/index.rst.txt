TurtleThread is a tool inspired by `TurtleStitch <https://www.turtlestitch.org/>`_ and powered by `pyembroidery <https://github.com/EmbroidePy/pyembroidery>`_ that lets you
program an embroidery machine with a Turtle interface. 

To learn how to use TurtleThread, we recommend looking at the `introduction to TurtleThread <auto_examples/gallery_introduksjon.html>`_
or any of the other `example scripts <auto_examples/index.html>`_.
